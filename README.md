# Linear Equation Solver

## Overview

This Python program is a simple linear equation solver. It takes a user-input linear equation, processes it, and returns the solution for the variable 'x'. The solver can handle equations with one equal sign and supports both positive and negative coefficients.

## Usage

**Input Format:**
   Enter a linear equation when prompted, e.g., "2x + 3 = 5."

**Output:**
   The program will display the solution for 'x' if the equation is solvable.
   In case of errors (invalid input or unsolvable equations), appropriate error messages will be provided.

## Example

### Input:

Enter a linear equation (e.g., 2x + 3 = 5): 12x + 12x + 13 = 60

### Output:

The solution is x = 2.0


## Notes

The program intelligently combines like terms and handles various input formats.
It checks for the validity of the input equation and provides informative error messages when necessary.
The solver assumes a coefficient of 1.0 for 'x' if not explicitly provided.

Feel free to experiment with different linear equations and explore the solver's capabilities!
